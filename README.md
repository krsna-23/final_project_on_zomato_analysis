Sure! Here's a sample README for a Zomato Data Analysis project:

Zomato Data Analysis Project-
Introduction
This project aims to analyze Zomato's restaurant data to uncover insights into customer behavior, preferences, and industry trends. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we provide a comprehensive overview of the dining landscape.

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Importing necessary libraries, reading and merging datasets, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing basic statistics and visualizations to explore the data.
Visualization Dashboards: Creating interactive dashboards for country-based and city-based analysis.
Data Preprocessing
Importing Libraries: Essential libraries like Pandas, Plotly, Dash, Seaborn, and Matplotlib are imported.
Reading Data: Loading Zomato's main dataset and country information dataset.
Merging Data: Combining datasets based on the 'Country Code'.
Feature Engineering: Creating new columns such as 'Converted Cost (INR)' and splitting the 'Cuisines' column for detailed analysis.
Saving Processed Data: Exporting the processed data to a new CSV file.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loading Data: Importing the processed data for analysis.
Basic Statistics: Generating histograms, count plots, scatter plots, and box plots to understand the data distribution.
Country-Based Analysis: Analyzing cuisine types, ratings, delivery services, and cost analysis for different countries.
City-Based Analysis: Examining famous cuisines, costlier cuisines, rating counts, and delivery modes for various cities.
